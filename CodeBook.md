#The following is a Code Book for the "tidyData.txt" file (which can be created by using the 'run_analysis.R' script)

There are a total of 180 rows and 68 columns in this dataset.
The rows correspond to 30 participants that were measured on 6 different activity levels (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting,
Standing, Laying).  The final table includes only the means for each participant for each activity, which results in 180 rows (30 x 6).
The columns correspond to 1) an ID variable representing each participant, 2) an Activity label (for the aforementioned activity levels), and 
3) a set of variabels corresponding to various measurements that are referrred to as the 'features'.


Here is an example of the 'features' from the UCI HAR Dataset Documentation:
"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."
